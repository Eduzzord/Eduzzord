### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have no idea what I'm doing here, I'm a mechanical engineer who is too lazy to do routine and commonplace tasks, and I try to learn ways to optimize my time. In the end, everything serves as learning and anger, after all I have no idea how to program, but I try... I think.

If you want to help me, I'll be posting here my ideas and projects...
